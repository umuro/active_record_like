ActiveRecordLike
================

You can delegate persistance to other mediums instead of SQL. Be it XML, Memcache, LDAP, even a C# object, whatever.
ActiveRecordLike gets a storage adapter and uses it instead of SQL unlike the ActiveRecord itself.
You can adapt, scaffold and show anything at all.

Unit tests include an example CacheAdapter where the ActiveRecords are going to the cache as the storage directly. 
Using CacheAdapter as an example you can write new storage adapters.

I actually used this library to scaffold objects returned by a C# library!
